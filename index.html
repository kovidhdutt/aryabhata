                <p>Aryabhata, also called Aryabhata I or Aryabhata the Elder, (born 476, possibly Ashmaka or Kusumapura,
                    India), astronomer and the earliest Indian mathematician whose work and history are available to
                    modern scholars. He is also known as Aryabhata I or Aryabhata the Elder to distinguish him from a
                    10th-century Indian mathematician of the same name. He flourished in Kusumapura—near Patalipurta
                    (Patna), then the capital of the Gupta dynasty—where he composed at least two works, Aryabhatiya (c.
                    499) and the now lost Aryabhatasiddhanta.

                    Aryabhatasiddhanta circulated mainly in the northwest of India and, through the Sāsānian dynasty
                    (224–651) of Iran, had a profound influence on the development of Islamic astronomy. Its contents
                    are preserved to some extent in the works of Varahamihira (flourished c. 550), Bhaskara I
                    (flourished c. 629), Brahmagupta (598–c. 665), and others. It is one of the earliest astronomical
                    works to assign the start of each day to midnight.</p>
                <p>Aryabhatiya was particularly popular in South India, where numerous mathematicians over the ensuing
                    millennium wrote commentaries. The work was written in verse couplets and deals with mathematics and
                    astronomy. Following an introduction that contains astronomical tables and Aryabhata’s system of
                    phonemic number notation in which numbers are represented by a consonant-vowel monosyllable, the
                    work is divided into three sections: Ganita (“Mathematics”), Kala-kriya (“Time Calculations”), and
                    Gola (“Sphere”).

                    In Ganita Aryabhata names the first 10 decimal places and gives algorithms for obtaining square and
                    cubic roots, using the decimal number system. Then he treats geometric measurements—employing
                    62,832/20,000 (= 3.1416) for π, very close to the actual value 3.14159—and develops properties of
                    similar right-angled triangles and of two intersecting circles. Using the Pythagorean theorem, he
                    obtained one of the two methods for constructing his table of sines. He also realized that
                    second-order sine difference is proportional to sine. Mathematical series, quadratic equations,
                    compound interest (involving a quadratic equation), proportions (ratios), and the solution of
                    various linear equations are among the arithmetic and algebraic topics included. Aryabhata’s general
                    solution for linear indeterminate equations, which Bhaskara I called kuttakara (“pulverizer”),
                    consisted of breaking the problem down into new problems with successively smaller
                    coefficients—essentially the Euclidean algorithm and related to the method of continued fractions.

                    With Kala-kriya Aryabhata turned to astronomy—in particular, treating planetary motion along the
                    ecliptic. The topics include definitions of various units of time, eccentric and epicyclic models of
                    planetary motion (see Hipparchus for earlier Greek models), planetary longitude corrections for
                    different terrestrial locations, and a theory of “lords of the hours and days” (an astrological
                    concept used for determining propitious times for action).

                    Aryabhatiya ends with spherical astronomy in Gola, where he applied plane trigonometry to spherical
                    geometry by projecting points and lines on the surface of a sphere onto appropriate planes. Topics
                    include prediction of solar and lunar eclipses and an explicit statement that the apparent westward
                    motion of the stars is due to the spherical Earth’s rotation about its axis. Aryabhata also
                    correctly ascribed the luminosity of the Moon and planets to reflected sunlight.</p>

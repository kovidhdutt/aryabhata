    <h1 class="text-info mt-5">Discoveries in Astronomy</h1>
    <p>Aryabhatta rightly insisted that the earth rotates daily on its axis around the sun and the movement of stars
      appeared to be because of the relative motion caused due to the rotation of the earth. This was in contrast to the
      then very popular belief that it was the sky that rotates. With calculated evidence, it was explained that
      heliocentrism is the rotation of planets around the sun, axially.His astronomical discoveries are majorly divided
      into four sections. These include an explanation of the motion of
      the solar system, eclipses, sidereal periods and heliocentrism.</p>
    <h3 class="mt-5">The Motion of the Solar System</h3>
    <p>Aryabhatta suggested that the earth rotates on its axis daily. And the relative movement of the stars is caused
      by the motion of the earth.In this first chapter of his book Aryabhatiyam, he mentions the numberof earth rotations in a yuga.To explain this phenomenon, he proposed a geometrical model of the solar system in which the moon and sun were
      carried by epicycles which means a circle moving on another circle. According to this model, the motion of the
      planets was governed by two epicycles. The smaller one was slow and the larger one was fast.In terms of the distance from the earth, the order of the planets was- the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars,
      Jupiter, Saturn and the asterisms (group of stars). The periods and positions of the planets were calculated on
      the relative motion of the points.In the case of Venus and Mercury, they moved with the same mean speed as the Sun
      around the Earth. However, Jupiter, Saturn and Mars, stars or points moved around the Earth at a specific velocity
      representing the motion of each planet through a zodiac.</p>
      <h3 class="mt-3">Eclipses</h3>
      <p>Aryabhata explained lunar and solar eclipses with scientific experiments. He stated that the planets and the Moonshine due to the reflected sunlight. He explained the eclipses in terms of shadows falling on the Earth.A lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth’s shadow is blocked by the Moon. Later, he discussed the extent and size of the Earth’s shadow and then computed the size of the eclipsed part during an eclipse. Aryabhatta experiments laid the foundation for Indian astronomers to improve the calculations.</p>
      <h3 class="mt-3">Sidereal Periods</h3>
      <p>Considering the modern units of time, Aryabhatta calculated the sidereal rotation ( the rotation of the Earth concerning the stars) as 23 hours, 56 minutes and 4.1 seconds. The modern value of time was written as 23:56:4.091</p>
      <h3 class="mt-3">Heliocentrism</h3>
      <p>Aryabhatta gave an astronomical model which stated that the Earth rotates on its axis. His model also gave corrections for the calculations of mean speeds of the planets concerning the Sun. His calculations were based on the heliocentric model in which the planets and the Earth revolve around the Sun at the centre of the universe. 

        The geocentric model of the solar system was described by Aryabhata, scientifically explaining the solar and lunar eclipses.  He also estimated the length of the year to be 365 days 6 hours 12 minutes 30 seconds which only deviates from today’s calculations by 3 minutes 20 seconds.</p>

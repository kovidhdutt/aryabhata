    <h1 class="text-info mt-5">Mathematical Invention and Discoveries</h1>
    <p>In Aryabhatiya Indian Mathematical Literature was extensively mentioned. The Vedic way to solve mathematical problems was explored and unsurprisingly this has also survived to modern times. The details of algebra, arithmetic, plane trigonometry, spherical trigonometry were discussed. He followed the Sanskrutik tradition or method of calculations that were prevalent in the Vedic Times. The title of ‘Father Of Algebra’ was given to Aryabhata, due to his notable understanding and explanation of planetary systems using it. Aryabhata correctly concluded the value of pi up to 2 decimal places, 3.14. He also used null coefficients and very rightly was aware of the use of zero in such a place. He used Sanskritic tradition that was mainly denoted by letters and alphabets, unlike the Brahmi numeral.</p>
    <h3 class="mt-3">The Concept of Zero</h3>
    <p>In Aryabhatiya, he introduced a “system of numerals” using Indian alphabets to designate numbers. His number
      system ensured that one would represent numbers up to 1018 with an alphabetical notation. It is considered that
      Aryabhata was familiar with the concept of zero and the place value system.</p>
    <p>However, the symbol zero is found nowhere in Aryabhata’s works. French mathematician Georges Ifrah argued that
      the knowledge and existence of zero were indirectly mentioned in Aryabhata’s place-value system as a placeholder
      for the powers of 10 with null coefficients. </p>
    <h3 class="mt-3">Calculation of Pi</h3>
    <p>Aryabhata calculated the value of Pi up to two decimal places, or 3.14. Then, in the second part of the
      Aryabhatiyam, he explained that to add four to a hundred, multiply it by eight. Then, add 62,000 again. As the
      rule concludes, one can find the circumference of a circle with a diameter of 20,000. This way gives you the value
      of Pi, 62832/20000=3.1416. Aryabhata’s value of Pi is a close approximation of the contemporary value and the most
      accurate one amongst the ancients.</p>
    <h3 class="mt-3">The First Known Person to Resolve Diophantine Equations</h3>
    <p>A Diophantine equation consists of more than one unknown integer. For example, ax∓by=c where the given integers
      are a, b, and c while the unknown integers are x and y. Aryabhata was the earliest known man to find a solution to
      this equation of the form by = ax + c and by = ax – c. Aryabhata promptly discovered a popular but new method
      called the “Kuttaka method” for this purpose. Kuttaka means “to pulverize,” and the method was based on a
      recursive algorithm which included writing the actual factors in smaller numbers. The equation was considered
      challenging to solve at that time, and the Kuttaka method quickly became very popular. The Kuttaka method is still
      the standard method to find solutions to such equations.</p>
    <h3 class="mt-3">Concept of Sine Table</h3>
    <p>Āryabhata's sine table is a set of twenty-four numbers given in the astronomical treatise Āryabhatiya composed by
      the fifth century Indian mathematician and astronomer Āryabhata (476–550 CE), for the computation of the
      half-chords of a certain set of arcs of a circle. The set of numbers appears in verse 12 in Chapter 1 Dasagitika
      of Aryabhatiya. It is not a table in the modern sense of a mathematical table; that is, it is not a set of numbers
      arranged into rows and columns. Āryabhaṭa's table is also not a set of values of the trigonometric sine function
      in a conventional sense; it is a table of the first differences of the values of trigonometric sines expressed in
      arcminutes, and because of this the table is also referred to as Āryabhaṭa's table of sine-differences.</p>
    <h3 class="mt-3">Trigonometry</h3>
    <p>Aryabhata discussed the concept of sine in his work by the name of ardha-jya, which literally means "half-chord".
      For simplicity, people started calling it jya. When Arabic writers translated his works from Sanskrit into Arabic,
      they referred it as jiba. However, in Arabic writings, vowels are omitted, and it was abbreviated as jb. Later
      writers substituted it with jaib, meaning "pocket" or "fold (in a garment)". (In Arabic, jiba is a meaningless
      word.) Later in the 12th century, when Gherardo of Cremona translated these writings from Arabic into Latin, he
      replaced the Arabic jaib with its Latin counterpart, sinus, which means "cove" or "bay"; thence comes the English
      word sine.</p>
